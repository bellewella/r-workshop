#Plots with ggplot2 

We are going to make plots in R and its going to be amazing. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(here)
```
```{r}
ca_np <-  read.csv(here("data", "ca_np.csv"))
```

```{r}
ci_np <- read_excel(here("data", "ci_np.xlsx"))
```

```{r}
gg_base <- ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors)) 

gg_base +
  geom_point(
    aes(size = visitors,
        color = visitors),
    alpha = 0.5
  )
```

```{r}
gg_base + 
  geom_col(aes(fill = visitors))
```
